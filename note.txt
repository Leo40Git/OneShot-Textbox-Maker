To add faces, simply add the face image to the "faces" folder, or any subfolder inside that folder!

If you want to use faces from the Solstice route (and potentially spoil yourself), delete the "nospoilers" file in the "faces" folder.

The "original" and "solstice" folder contains faces from the game itself. These belong to NightMargin, GIR and Eliza.
The "discord" folder contains faces from the OneShot Discord server. It seems whoever made them left the server...
