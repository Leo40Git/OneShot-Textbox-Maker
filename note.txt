-- OneShot Textbox Maker (OBSTM) --

WARNING! This application contains spoilers for Solstice (if you count facepics as spoilers)!

To add facepics, simply add the facepic image to the "faces" folder in the "res" folder, or any subfolder inside that folder!

The "original" and "solstice" folder contains facepics from the game itself. These belong to NightMargin, GIR and Eliza.
The "osdiscord" folder contains facepics from the OneShot Discord server. It seems whoever made them left the server...
